# Blackjack-with-GUI
Its a blackjack card game made in python with a GUI made with tkinter
This is a faculty project that I enjoyed really much doing.
I needed to make any game I wanted and decided to make a blackjack game
with a betting system.
You have 2 options, to play it with a console UI or a nice GUI made with tkinter.
All you need to do to make it work is to have tkinter installed and change
the tkinter directory in the CMAKE file with the directory you have tkinter installed.
